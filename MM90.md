# Contest: Marathon Match 90 
# Problem: RollingBalls

## Problem Statement

> You are given a maze. Each cell of the maze contains a wall, an empty cell or a ball of some color. 

あなたは迷路を与えられています。迷路の各セルは、壁、空のセルまたはいくつかの色のボールが含まれています。

> You are given the starting configuration of the maze.

あなたは、迷路の開始設定を与えられています。

> You want to move the balls into another, target configuration.

あなたは、別のものに目標設定をボールを移動したいです。

> To do this, you can roll balls, one at a time, in straight lines (horizontal or vertical).

これを行うには、直線（水平または垂直）でボールを1つずつ、ロールバックすることができます。

> Once the ball starts rolling, it stops only when it hits a wall or another ball (which does NOT start moving).

ボールが転がり始めると、それは壁や別のボール（移動を開始しません）に当たったときにのみ停止します。

> Balls can't roll out of the maze, so they stop when they hit a border of the maze.

ボールは迷路の外にロールすることはできませんので、彼らが迷路の境界を打ったとき、彼らは停止します。

> Each rolls starts only after the previously rolling ball has stopped, so at any time there is at most one rolling ball in the maze. 

いつでも最大1つのローリングボールが迷路にありように、各ロールは、以前にローリングボールが停止した後にのみ開始されます。

---

> You have to do at most 20 * (number of balls in the maze) rolls.

あなたは、ほとんどの20 *（迷路中のボールの数）のロールで行う必要があります。

> After all balls stop moving, their configuration must be as close to the target one as possible.

すべてのボールが移動を停止した後、その構成は、ターゲット可能な限り1に近くなければなりません。

---

## Implementation Details

> Your code should implement one method restorePattern(vector <string> start, vector <string> target).

あなたのコードは、1つのメソッドrestorePattern(vector <string> start, vector <string> target)を実装する必要があります。

> start and target give the starting and the target configurations of the maze, formatted as follows: character j of element i represents cell in row i and column j. '#' is a wall, '.' is an empty cell, '0'..'9' are balls of various colors. Walls are located in the same cells in start and target, the only difference is in the positions of the balls. The set of balls' colors will also be the same.

起動して、次のようにターゲットはフォーマット開始と迷路のターゲット構成を与える：要素の文字jはiがiとj列の行のセルを表します。 「＃」は、壁です '。'様々な色のボールで、空のセルされた '0' .. '9'。壁を起動し、ターゲット内の同じセルに配置されている、唯一の違いは、ボールの位置にあります。ボール「色のセットも同じになります。

> Your return from this method should be a vector <string>, containing at most 20 * (number of balls in the maze) elements.

この方法からのあなたのリターンは、要素（迷路にボールの数）最大で20 *を含む、ベクトル<文字列>でなければなりません。

> Each element of your return should be formatted as "R C D", where R and C are row and column coordinates of the ball you want to roll, and D is the direction of roll: 0 decreases column, 1 increases row, 2 increases column and 3 decreases row. (See visualizer for implementation of roll directions.)

各要素は"R C D"のフォーマットでなければならない。ここで、RとCはロールしたいボールの行と列の座標で、Dはロールの方向である。0は列を減少、1は行を増加、2は列を増加、3は行を減少である。（visualizerを見よ）

---

## Scoring

> Your score for a test case will be calculated as follows.

次のようにテストケースのためのあなたのスコアが計算されます。

> For each ball in target configuration you get 1 point if the end configuration has a ball of the same color in this cell, or else 0.5 points if it has a ball of different color in this cell.

セルと同じ色のボールがセルにある場合１点、違う色の場合0.5点

The score is the sum of points for each ball in target congifuration, divided by the total number of balls in the maze.

スコアは各ボールの平均点。

> If your return contains an invalid roll or too many rolls, your score for this test case will be 0.

あなたのリターンが無効なロールまたはあまりにも多くのロールが含まれている場合は、このテストケースのためのあなたのスコアは0です。

> Your overall score will be a sum of your scores for individual test cases.
あなたの全体的なスコアは、個々のテストケースのためのあなたのスコアの合計になりますになります。

---

## Test Case Generation

- Width and height of the maze are chosen between 10 and 60, inclusive.

- The number of colors is chosen between 1 and 10, inclusive.

- Walls density is chosen between 10% and 30%.

- Balls density in empty cells is chosen between 5% and 20%.

- Each color is selected with equal probability.

- Target configuration is generated as follows: each cell is generated independently, containing a wall, a ball of some color or an empty space.

- To get start configuration, random balls are rolled in random directions until they hit a wall, a border of the maze or another ball.

## Tools

An offline tester/visualizer is available here. You can use it to test/debug your solution locally. You can also check its source code for exact implementation of test case generation and score calculation.
